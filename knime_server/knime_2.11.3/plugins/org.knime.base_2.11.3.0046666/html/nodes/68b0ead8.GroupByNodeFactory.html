<h1>GroupBy</h1>
<p>
    	   <p>
    	    Groups the rows of a table by the unique values in the selected group columns.
    	    A row is created for each unique set of values of the selected group column. 
    	    The remaining columns are aggregated based on the specified aggregation settings.
            The output table contains one row for each unique value combination of the selected 
            group columns.
           </p>
           <p>
           The columns to aggregate can be either defined by selecting the columns directly, 
           by name based on a search pattern or based on the data type. Input columns are handled in
           this order and only considered once e.g. columns that are added directly on the
           "Manual Aggregation" tab are ignored even if their name matches a search pattern on the 
           "Pattern Based Aggregation" tab or their type matches a defined type on the
           "Type Based Aggregation" tab. The same holds for columns that are added based on a search pattern. 
           They are ignored even if they match a criterion that has been defined in the "Type Based Aggregation" tab.
           </p>
           <p>
            The "Manual Aggregation" tab allows you to change the aggregation method of more than one 
            column. In order to do so select the columns to change, open the context menu with a right mouse click
            and select the aggregation method to use.
           </p>
           <p>
            In the "Pattern Based Aggregation" tab you can assign aggregation methods to columns based on a  
            search pattern. The pattern can be either a string with wildcards or a
            <a href="http://www.java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html#sum">regular expression</a>.
            Columns where the name matches the pattern but where the data type is not compatible with the
            selected aggregation method are ignored. Only columns that have not been selected as group column or 
            that have not been selected as aggregation column on the "Manual Aggregation" tab are considered.
           </p>
           <p>
            The "Type Based Aggregation" tab allows to select an aggregation method for all columns of a certain 
            data type e.g. to compute the mean for all numerical columns (DoubleCell). Only columns that have not 
            been handled by the other tabs e.g. group, column based and pattern based are considered.
            The data type list to choose from contains basic types e.g String, Double, etc. and all data types 
            the current input table contains.
           </p>
           <p>
            A detailed description of the available aggregation methods can be
            found on the 'Description' tab in the node dialog.

<dd>
                Defines the maximum number of unique values per group to avoid 
                problems with memory overloading. All groups with more unique
                values are skipped during the calculation and a missing value is set 
                in the corresponding column, and a warning is displayed.

            <dt>Column naming</dt>
<dd>
                The name of the resulting aggregation column(s) depends on the 
                selected naming schema.

                    <li>Keep original name(s):
                    Keeps the original column names.
                    Note that you can use all aggregation columns only once with 
                    this column naming option to prevent duplicate column names.
                    </li>
                    <li>Aggregation method (column name): 
                    Uses the aggregation method first and appends the column name
                    in brackets
                    </li>
                    <li>Column name (aggregation method):
                    Uses the column name first and appends the aggregation method

                    </li>
                </ul>
                All aggregation methods get a * appended if the missing value option 
                is not ticked in the aggregation settings in order to distinguish
                between columns that considered missing values in the aggregation
                process and columns that do not.
            </dd>
            <dt>Enable hiliting</dt>
<dd>
                If enabled, the hiliting of a group row will hilite all rows of this
                group in other views. Depending on the number of rows, enabling this 
                feature might consume a lot of memory.
            </dd>
            <dt>Value delimiter</dt>
<dd>
                The value delimiter used by aggregation methods such as concatenate. 
            </dd>
            <dt>Process in memory</dt>
<dd>
                Process the table in the memory. Requires more memory but is faster
                since the table needs not to be sorted prior aggregation. 
                The memory consumption depends on the number of unique groups and
                the chosen aggregation method. The row order of the input table is 
                automatically retained.
            </dd>
            <dt>Retain row order</dt>
<dd>
                Retains the original row order of the input table. 
                Could result in longer execution time.
                The row order is automatically retained if the process in memory
                option is selected.

                column of the table. You can add the same column multiple

                <a href="http://www.java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html#sum">regular expression</a>.
                Supported wildcards are * (matches any number of characters) and ? (matches one character) e.g. KNI*
                would match all strings that start with KNI such as KNIME whereas KNI? would match only strings that start
                with KNI followed by a fourth character. 
                Double click the "Search pattern" cell to edit the pattern. 
                The cell is colored in red if the pattern is invalid.
